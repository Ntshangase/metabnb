#This is where i share my journey during the build of this project. 
-A more intresting readMe file which anyone can read to understand what's going on with 
the project. Sometimes i look at the readme's and i'm like 'damnn' where do i start.

.On first publish the app is suppose to be blank  because i have to start from afreash, 
and thats thanks to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQAHSlTtcmY 
This is a very good video on how to get react app up and running.
#Creating Metabnb, a airbnb clone basically.
-this is definetly the hardest project i have come to face so far in my career. 
-I really don't understand what's expected of me, i don't know what i should use, like i'm blank in real
life.

-but since yesterday i have made progrees. this task is due: 16November which is in real time just 6days from
now and i stil have to do other real work on the side. This is off my calibrer, if i want to test myself
I should be doing these extra hard stuff just to build the muscles.
. I know:
	-we should use react and any css framework
	-due on 16November 2022
	-there is a lot of emphasis on mobile responsive-ness which i currently don't understand at the moment.
.I should:
	-get all the required images required.
	-create react app
	-figure out what the hell responsive mobile view means.
	-get the RGB values, they said on the slack channell if you right click on the page you can get the info about values the color and other things are.
.I have:
	-succesfully exported 'all' required images from the figma design. I had to create a figma account also. Like figuring
	out how to export was too easy. My view of how hard thing does affect how i do them, so i need to get back to real work
	mode, like what the fuck.//this vacation me is not my favourite just get on with it broe the help is there but if you
	are going to give up on the first sign of hardship then get the fuck out. Since that lovely speech is out the way...
	-I can get the correct RGB values now. You have to use the figma page there is inspect where you can see the css properties and export if you want to download the images. Figma is really to use.

.I feels like this is where i get out, this shit really hard. like wow. but after this it's going to get easier for you bro.why not just push and pass stage 4 then you defintly getting into the finals.
.Ok i will break this down into componets like i should and will build a real working app.
.This thing is actually nice i'm learning here, Embrace googling.

.This is actually not that  hard, i can do it (luaghs out loud).
.This thing is easy, just pulled it off. Time is my only challenge really.
